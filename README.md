## Overview

A Golang lock-free thread-safe HashMap optimized for fastest read access.

It requires Golang 1.19+ as it makes use of Generics and the new atomic package helpers. 

***Warning: This library and derived work is experimental and should not be used in production. It contains an unfixed
bug that can cause writes to be lost.***

## Usage

The supported key types are string, int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr.

Set a value for a key in the map:

```
m := New[string, int]()
m.Set("amount", 123)
```

Read a value for a key from the map:
```
value, ok := m.Get("amount")
```

Use the map to count URL requests:
```
m := New[string, *int64]()
var i int64
counter, _ := m.GetOrInsert("api/123", &i)
atomic.AddInt64(counter, 1) // increase counter
...
count := atomic.LoadInt64(counter) // read counter
```

## Benchmarks

Reading from the hash map in a thread-safe way is nearly as fast as reading from a standard Golang map
in an unsafe way and twice as fast as Go's `sync.Map`:

```
BenchmarkReadHashMapUint-8                       2542633               480.2 ns/op
BenchmarkReadGoMapUintUnsafe-8                   3314827               357.8 ns/op
BenchmarkReadGoMapUintMutex-8                      85088             14003 ns/op
BenchmarkReadGoSyncMapUint-8                      961533              1276 ns/op
```

Reading from the map while writes are happening:
```
BenchmarkReadHashMapWithWritesUint-8             1847887               652.3 ns/op
BenchmarkReadGoMapWithWritesUintMutex-8            21160             65015 ns/op
BenchmarkReadGoSyncMapWithWritesUint-8            786846              1489 ns/op
```

Write performance without any concurrent reads:

```
BenchmarkWriteHashMapUint-8                        27554             44950 ns/op
BenchmarkWriteGoMapMutexUint-8                    163479              6831 ns/op
BenchmarkWriteGoSyncMapUint-8                      22702             58090 ns/op
```

The benchmarks were run with Golang 1.18.3 on Linux using `make benchmark`.

### Benefits over Golang's builtin map

* Faster

* thread-safe access without need of a(n extra) mutex

* [Compare-and-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap) access for values

### Benefits over [Golang's sync.Map](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Map)

* Faster

## Technical details

* Technical design decisions have been made based on benchmarks that are stored in an external repository:
  [go-benchmark](https://github.com/cornelk/go-benchmark)

* The library uses a sorted doubly linked list and a slice as an index into that list.

* The Get() function contains helper functions that have been inlined manually until the Golang compiler will inline them automatically.

* It optimizes the slice access by circumventing the Golang size check when reading from the slice.
  Once a slice is allocated, the size of it does not change.
  The library limits the index into the slice, therefore the Golang size check is obsolete.
  When the slice reaches a defined fill rate, a bigger slice is allocated and all keys are recalculated and transferred into the new slice.
